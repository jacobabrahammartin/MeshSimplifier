MeshSimplifier: Efficient Mesh Optimization Tool for Unity

Enhance your 3D projects in Unity with MeshSimplifier, a user-friendly, powerful tool for managing mesh complexity. Designed with flexibility and performance in mind, MeshSimplifier is perfect for developers working on optimized experiences in VR, AR, and mobile applications.
Key Features

    Mesh Simplification: Adjustable simplification ratio reduces triangle counts for performance gains.
    Subdivision Control: Dynamically control subdivision levels for custom levels of detail.
    Restorable Simplification: Restore the original mesh anytime, allowing you to temporarily simplify complex models without altering the original structure.
    Caching System: Efficient caching for multiple subdivision levels, ensuring rapid adjustments.
    Undo Support: Restore original meshes with a click, maintaining flexibility during design.

Why Use MeshSimplifier?

When developing with high-topology models, the detailed structure often needs to be reduced for smoother performance or to free up resources. MeshSimplifier is ideal for situations where:

    Performance Optimization is needed during testing or for in-game assets with high detail.
    Prototyping: Temporarily reduce complexity in models, optimizing development speed while still preserving the original for final renders.
    Iteration: Restore the mesh at any point to refine the topology, making it easier to balance model quality and performance without needing multiple model versions.
